# SQLAlchemy-Challenge

In this challenged I worked with both jupyter notebook and a python app to analyze sqllite and data on a csv file. Also had to do a lot of Google Fu for the extra credit. I also had to install a newer version of scipy to be able to do a two sided paired t-test as I didn't know what was the preference of temperature in Hawaii for the assignment.
